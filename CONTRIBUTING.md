# Contributing
This repository is open to contributors and React.js developers.

Any bugs in site? You can submit in Issues tab so any contributors will fix the bug you have seen in our site anytime.

Note that you cannot access the remote `master` branch as you clone in this main repository `leafstudiosDot/hodots-docs` or the origin is `leafstudiosDot/hodots-docs` (not your forked repository).

If you have access to the source code of the hodots. Services, You can probably make a page for this documentation, otherwise you can modify the style of the site but it follows how [hodots. Web](https://hodots.com) looks.

## How can I contribute?
1. Fork this repository. Meaning you can have this repository as your own and start development on it or have your forked repository (from this repository) to contribute to the original repository.
2. Clone `git clone` to your local machine with your forked repository to get started.
3. Create your desired branch `git branch (your feature)`.
4. After you modify some files for the feature, Add your modified files to git `git add .`. Make sure you check your modified files `git status` to decide the file you are going to stage for commit.
5. Commit your changes to save a point `git commit -m "(Commit message)"`.
6. Push your commits to the forked repository (not the upstream) `git push -u origin (your feature's branch name)`.
7. Post a Pull Request. Go to your forked remote repository in GitHub and you can see the notification with a button "Compare & pull request".
8. As you are in a "Open a pull request" page, the title should be the title of the feature you wish to add. Comment is optional whatever you like it. Then you can press the "Create pull request". That's how you contribute folks, just wait for my review to merge in the main repository `leafstudiosDot/hodots-docs`.
